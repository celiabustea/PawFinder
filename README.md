# 🐾 PawFinder

**ItFest 2025 Submission**  
*Find Your Lost Friend, Fast.*

PawFinder is a cross-platform mobile app built with React Native that helps users **report and find missing pets** using **AI-powered image matching**. With real-time updates, location-based searches, and a user-friendly interface, PawFinder makes reuniting with lost pets easier and faster.

Note: This app was developed in just 48 hours during the ItFest hackathon, and it is quite old and unfinished.
As a result, it might not work properly due to version conflicts and other issues that I wasn’t able to fix after reopening the project.
